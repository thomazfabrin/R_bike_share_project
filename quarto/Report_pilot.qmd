## Introduction
::: {.justify}
This is the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study. The marketing team at Cyclistic aims to maximize annual memberships. 
To design a marketing strategy for converting casual riders into annual members, it is necessary to understand how these two groups
use Cyclistic bikes differently. Any recommendations must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## About the company
Cyclistic, launched in 2016, has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles across 692 stations in Chicago. The company offers single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders are customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes, while annual members are those who purchase annual memberships. 
The final goal is to design marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members by analyzing Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to identify trends.
